## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

- I learned to make an arrow using pseudo elements
- I learned to superpose divs using the position property
- I learned how to use the BEM methodology

```css
.space:after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    left: calc(100% - 0.7rem);
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border: 20px solid transparent;
    border-top-color: white;
    border-bottom: 0;
    border-right: 0;
    margin-left: -10px;
    margin-bottom: -20px;
  }
```


### Continued development

- I want to keep working on writing clean code using the BEM methodology.
